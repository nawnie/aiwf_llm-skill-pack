description: Coordinate AIWF and MoK local dataset research, curation, validation, and cleanup. Use when sorting daily automated dataset research, validating sources and licenses, cleaning current dataset libraries, generating additive dataset artifacts, planning dataset freshness or media duration gates, curating text/image/video/audio data, captioning multimodal datasets, preparing Data Analytics dashboards or reports, or applying AI-writing guardrails to original research and synthetic guardrail training data.

# AIWF Dataset

Use this skill as the coordinator for local-first dataset intake, validation, cleanup, and reporting. Prefer existing specialized skills for heavy work, but keep the operating contract here: verify the real root, preserve provenance, label synthetic material, and avoid destructive cleanup.

## Operating Rules

- Verify the active repo or dataset root before acting. If `datasets/` or `.git` is missing, report that and continue only with root-independent work.
- Keep MoK and AIWF work local unless the user explicitly asks to publish, push, upload, or open a pull request.
- Treat current dataset work as a library or candidate corpus unless the user explicitly asks for a final merged training set.
- Do not delete, truncate, overwrite, or append into an existing subject dataset folder. Write a new folder, manifest version, quarantine report, or patch file instead.
- Preserve receipts: source URLs, access dates, license notes, hashes when available, source type, generated-by fields, validation results, and unresolved issues.
- When facts could be current or unstable, verify with primary or official sources. Do not reuse stale model memory as a source of truth.
- Use AI-writing checks as writing-quality signals, not authorship proof.
- Allow AI-generated text for synthetic guardrail training rows only when it is labeled and separated. Original research used as the factual basis for a dataset must come from human-authored, official, primary, or otherwise traceable non-synthetic sources.

## Workflow

1. Verify scope.
   - Identify the active root, target dataset folders, requested modalities, and whether the work is intake, cleanup, generation, validation, or reporting.
   - Run `scripts/validate_dataset_receipts.py <root>` for a cheap read-only pass when working on local dataset folders.

2. Route to the right reference.
   - For source vetting and daily automated research, read `references/research-validation.md`.
   - For freshness windows, media duration gates, retention, and cleanup cadence, read `references/curation-lifecycle.md`.
   - For image, video, audio, captions, embeddings, or scene/clip extraction, read `references/multimodal-captioning.md`.
   - For dashboards, reports, or handoff artifacts, read `references/reporting-widgets.md`.
   - For AI-writing boundaries and guardrail training data, read `references/guardrails-ai-writing.md`.
   - For the reviewed companion skills and when to call them, read `references/current-skill-map.md`.

3. Validate research before curation.
   - Separate raw intake from accepted sources.
   - Classify each source as primary, official, peer-reviewed, dataset card, repository, benchmark, secondary, scraped, model-generated, or unknown.
   - Reject or quarantine sources with unclear origin, missing license, broken citations, AI citation markup leaks, placeholder text, or unsupported claims.

4. Curate and clean.
   - For small local passes, use scripts and standard parsers first.
   - For large text or multimodal corpora, use the NeMo Curator skill for deduplication, quality filtering, PII redaction, NSFW checks, and GPU-scale processing.
   - For generic distributed ETL or batch inference, use Ray Data.
   - For semantic duplicate checks, use sentence-transformers and FAISS.

5. Caption and label multimodal data.
   - Keep raw file metadata, model captions, verified captions, and source captions in separate fields.
   - Record model name, prompt or config hash, confidence, reviewer, and validation status for generated captions.
   - Do not promote generated captions into factual ground truth without a verification step.

6. Report outcomes.
   - Summarize reviewed folders, files changed, sources accepted, sources rejected or quarantined, validation results, and judgment calls.
   - For dashboard/report requests, build a bounded Data Analytics artifact and validate it before rendering.

## Default Local Checks

Use the bundled validator before and after cleanup work:

```powershell
python .\skills\aiwf-dataset\scripts\validate_dataset_receipts.py .\datasets
python .\skills\aiwf-dataset\scripts\validate_dataset_receipts.py .\datasets --strict --json
```

The script is read-only. It checks root existence, manifest/source-registry parseability, JSONL parseability, duplicate IDs, missing IDs, common placeholder leaks, common AI citation leaks, and expected receipt files.

## Output Contract

End with:

- Dataset root inspected.
- Sources or folders reviewed.
- Files changed or new files written.
- Validation commands and results.
- Accepted, rejected, quarantined, or needs-review counts.
- Remaining gaps that need user judgment.
