description: AIWF design-audit and rewrite workflow for removing generic AI-designed UI and document layout patterns. Use when Codex must detect, audit, or fix AI-looking design in Gradio apps, PDFs, document layouts, web pages, React/Tailwind/shadcn, dashboards, static sites, screenshots, generated reports, or frontend code. Triggers include teal everywhere, purple or blue gradients, generic rounded-card layouts, default Gradio/shadcn styling, AI-looking PDF reports, document layout cleanup, de-slop UI, make it look less AI-generated, design complaints, or layout polish for local AI tools.

# AIWF Avoid AI Design

## What This Is

Use this skill to audit and fix design patterns that make local AI tools, reports, and websites look machine-generated.

This is a design-quality tool, not a verdict. A teal button, centered hero, or rounded card is not proof that a model made the artifact. The signal matters when defaults cluster: teal on every control, Inter everywhere, identical cards, generic PDF covers, decorative gradients, no layout rhythm, and no clear reason for any choice.

The job is simple: replace defaults with decisions while preserving the product, code behavior, data, accessibility, and document meaning.

## Runtime Defaults

Use normal reasoning by default; raise reasoning only for high-risk public surfaces, cross-file design systems, repeated failed visual passes, or source-backed design research.

When the host supports `/goal`, create or continue a goal for active design audit, rendering, edit, and verification work. Use no fixed token ceiling, the largest available context limit, and unlimited or expanded tool-call limits where those controls exist. If the host requires finite settings, choose the highest available values except for reasoning, which stays normal unless the task warrants escalation.

Apply expanded budgets to the working phase: inspecting screenshots or files, rendering, editing, comparing before/after output, and verifying the result. Do not use expanded budget just to review old chat. Use standard context length to decide which prior instructions matter, then focus on the current artifact, files, design direction, and acceptance gates.

## Modes

`rewrite` is the default when the user points at files and wants them fixed.

`detect` flags design tells only. Use it when the user says scan, audit only, flag only, do not edit, or asks what looks AI-generated.

`edit` applies narrow in-place changes to named files. Use it when the user asks to clean a specific Gradio file, React component, CSS file, PDF source, report template, or document layout.

## Required Workflow

1. Scope the artifact: Gradio app, PDF/report, document, web page, React component, dashboard, screenshot, or full app.
2. Read the actual files first. If only a screenshot or PDF is provided, inspect the visual artifact directly.
3. If the result is visual and a renderer is available, render it. Use screenshots for web/React/Gradio and page renders for PDFs before making visual judgments.
4. Read `references/ai-design-tells.md` for the tell catalog.
5. Read `references/surface-fix-playbooks.md` for the relevant surface: Gradio, PDF/document, React/web, or dashboard.
6. For web pages, React surfaces, dashboards with public-facing areas, or marketing pages, read `references/modern-web-appeal.md` before judging what should replace the AI-looking design.
7. Audit by severity. Mark findings as `code-certain`, `visual-certain`, or `inferred`.
8. Commit to one direction before editing: palette stance, typography stance, layout stance, density, and one signature detail.
9. Edit narrowly. Preserve behavior, props, callbacks, data flow, routing, validation, labels with functional meaning, and accessibility.
10. Re-audit the result. Fix any P0 tells that survived.
11. Verify with the cheapest useful proof: screenshot, PDF render, local build, lint, focused test, or source diff.

## Severity

P0 means a non-designer notices it fast:

- teal used as the answer to every design problem
- purple/blue gradients, glow blobs, or gradient headline text
- default Gradio or shadcn styling shipped as the design
- centered hero plus three identical feature cards
- AI-looking PDF cover pages with huge title, teal strip, soft gradient, and icon cards
- every surface using the same radius, border, shadow, padding, and icon treatment

P1 means a designer or developer notices it:

- Inter, Roboto, Geist, or system stack with no pairing or hierarchy
- `rounded-2xl shadow-lg`, `container mx-auto px-4`, untouched `zinc` or `slate`
- Lucide `Sparkles`, `Zap`, `Rocket`, or emoji used as generic AI/product marks
- colored left-border cards, pill badges, four-column footers, fake stat strips
- Gradio tabs and accordions used as a dumping ground for every control
- PDF tables, callouts, and headings all using the same weight and spacing

P2 means craft polish:

- flat spacing rhythm
- weak contrast
- no empty/loading/error/focus states
- over-structured documents with too many headings and bullets
- motion that is either absent everywhere or copied everywhere

Fix P0 and P1 in normal passes. Fix P2 when it is cheap or when the surface is public-facing.

## Context Profiles

`gradio-local-ai`: Be practical and dense. Put core controls near the main action. Avoid decorative wrappers. Teal is allowed only as a restrained accent, not a whole theme.

`pdf-report`: Use a document grid, real hierarchy, source notes, page numbers, table discipline, and print-safe contrast. Avoid hero-style covers unless the report is meant for marketing.

`document-layout`: Preserve the content and reading order. Fix margins, headings, tables, callouts, captions, and section rhythm before changing wording.

`react-web`: Render before judging. Check CSS, Tailwind classes, component primitives, routes, states, and responsive behavior. Do not rebuild an app when a component pass is enough.

`dashboard`: Favor scan speed, density, clear grouping, status meaning, and tables that survive repeated use. Do not turn operational tools into landing pages.

`marketing-page`: Use real product/place/object imagery or screenshots when possible. The first viewport should signal the actual subject, not a generic value prop wrapper.

State which profile you are using and why.

## Source-Backed Web Appeal

For modern web pages, do not replace AI-looking design with trend-chasing. Use `references/modern-web-appeal.md` to ground the direction in human appeal, credibility, accessibility, responsiveness, and performance.

The short rule: appealing human design makes the page easier to trust, scan, use, and revisit. It does not hide the real product behind generic gradients, identical cards, vague claims, or heavy animation.

## Guardrails

- Do not break working UI or report generation to make it prettier.
- Do not trade teal for another default such as purple gradients, beige startup minimalism, or dark slate cards.
- Do not invent brand claims, metrics, testimonials, or product features.
- Do not hide core AIWF controls in advanced accordions when they should be obvious near Generate or Run.
- Do not add heavy dependencies or start GPU work unless the user asked for it.
- For prose-heavy copy, README/docs text, PDF narrative, or public-facing UI copy, run the AIWF prose scan from `aiwf-avoid-ai-pushes` before finalizing.
- If the artifact is already intentional, say so and stop. A clean audit is a valid result.

## Output Format

For `detect`:

1. Issues found, grouped by P0/P1/P2, with file or page location and confidence.
2. Assessment, with what must change and what is a judgment call.

For `rewrite` or `edit`:

1. Audit summary, grouped by severity.
2. Direction chosen, stated in concrete design moves.
3. Edits made, naming files and the meaningful changes.
4. Verification, including screenshot/build/test/PDF-render results when available.
5. Second-pass audit, especially whether any P0 tells remain.

Keep the final report short. The files and screenshots are the proof.
